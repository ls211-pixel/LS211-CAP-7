# Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this era or generation, we observe that many people are experiencing various health issues, one of the most critical being **Heart Failure** — including **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)**. These conditions can lead to fatal outcomes at any stage of life. Heart failure diseases are prevalent across the globe, making it essential to find effective solutions.

To address this issue, various medical techniques and methods are being utilized. In addition, advancements in **computer technology** — particularly **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and other computational methods — have shown great promise in tackling heart failure problems.

Our research focuses on leveraging these technologies, looking into previous studies, research papers, and methodologies developed by experts in the field. Furthermore, we analyze patient data to identify the angles and factors at which individuals are most affected by CVDs. **Machine Learning** emerges as a powerful tool for predicting heart failure with high accuracy and speed, making it a critical asset in modern medical research.

This research also explores how **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning algorithms** can be applied to CVDs, offering innovative approaches to combat heart failure. Training and learning from these algorithms allow us to create effective strategies, not only for heart disease prevention but also for future medical innovations and AI developments aimed at saving lives and advancing healthcare.

In the current medical landscape, several models and methods are utilized, such as:

- **Neural Networks (NN)**
- **Random Forests (RF)**
- **Decision Tree Models**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

These models play a crucial role in accurately predicting heart failure.

According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, approximately **18.9 million people** are affected by CVDs globally. Alarmingly, **33% of deaths** are caused by cardiovascular diseases, and among these, **75% of cases** are directly related to heart conditions. The primary causes include **hypertension**, **low blood pressure (BP)**, and various infections.

The most effective approach lies in using **Machine Learning** to detect complex datasets, medical algorithms, hidden patterns, and underlying logic related to heart failure. Ultimately, this research highlights how **Machine Learning** can significantly reduce mortality rates by predicting heart illness early. It also showcases the vast potential of AI and ML in identifying and combating heart diseases, driving innovation and saving countless lives.

## Mathematical or Statistical Methods

NAIVE BAYES:

Naïve bayes is a guided learning method that can solve any kind of classification models by applying the probability of the bayes theorem.This model is only trained for only and especially for the large and big data sets or the algorithms but coming to this method it will not correlated with one to another.
Its useful for the feature engineering.
This theorem also predicts based on the patient condition is he or she having good cholestral or any illness it shows very fast.
## Bayes' Theorem

Based on the information provided, we employ **Bayes' Theorem** in our study to forecast the likelihood of cardiac failure. The formula can be written as follows:

P(y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid y) \times P(y)}{P(X)} \[

The likelihood of heart failure given the data \( X \)- \( P(X \mid y) \) is as follows: The likelihood of seeing the data \( X \) in light of heart failure - \( P(y) \): Heart failure's prior probability - \( P(X) \): The likelihood that the data will be observed \( X \)

This statistical method helps to more precisely determine the chance of heart failure by updating probabilities as new information becomes available.
